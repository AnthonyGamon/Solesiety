            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p>As a kid I always had dope shoes thanks to my parents and grandparents, but the older I got I knew I wanted to have dope shoes. And once I finally started making money to consistently cop sneakers I made it happen. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> Hate to be basic and obvious, but I would say the Low Top Air Force One. I had the white pair with the blue swoosh! I think it was an anniversary special...but that was my first shoe I bought with my own money. AF1’s were the wave back then and that was my first pair! </p>

            <p> My collection is filled with kicks that I like. Now there is hype in it, but no one made me get it.  </p>

            <p> I’m going with history because I want what they had back in the day. And besides, who doesn’t like a good OG pair?!  </p>

            <p>My grail sneaker is the Black Cement 3. It was a pair that I wanted a while back but I was too broke to get em. Plus they are the OG pair that MJ had back when he played. </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>  Hmmmm good question! I would say the Fire Red 4’s! Personally OG pairs will forever be a Go-To for me. I remember I had a pair I got from a friend back in the day and I wore them until I couldn’t do it was a nostalgic vibe! And it looks like everyone got a pair so it sounds like it was more pairs to go around. Love to everyone win!   </p>
