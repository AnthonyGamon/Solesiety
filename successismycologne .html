            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> I got into the sneaker game when I was about 11-12 years old. It was DIPSET & my cousins who worked in a sneaker boutique (CNCPTS) . </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> The first pair of sneakers for me was the Gary Payton "Glove". It was given to me by my uncle. At the time I just started understanding "name brands sneakers and stuff. </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> It's a mix of a lot of dope brands. I value distinguished pairs over anything. And staples in each sneaker brand. I just enjoy getting what I really like & sneakers I know I'll be able to create some very dope outfits with. </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p>  History every-time cause longevity is important. I've never been a fan of "hot pocket" fashion. I'm the type of person to go with originals most of the time unless I'm really impressed by a new silhouette with distinguishing colorways.</p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p>Air Max 95 Atmos Animal. I remember 12+ years ago when it originally came out & I couldn't afford them. It always stuck in the back of my mind. That sneaker is me. Very versatile & goes with a lot.  </p>

            <p>   I'm gonna have to go with Air Jordan OW 5 without question. Such a timeless silhouette & the 3% Virgil additions made it even more dope. Yellow sole is just amazing.  </p>
