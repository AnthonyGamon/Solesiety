            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p>Around 2010, I was collecting mainly Jordan retro’s, air maxes & nike sb dunks </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> My first pair I bought with my own money was the 2010 flint 13’s</p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p>  It’s subtle but different. The type of collection that someone who doesnt know about sneakers would like, but also people who know kicks would appreciate </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> Depends. History is dope bc there’s a story, but it’s always good to get a new twist, something we haven’t seen. I like what Union does with mixing hype & history. </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> Probably some 2000 Infrared 6’s. The main pair I’ve always wanted & also my favorite jordan of all time</p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>  Personally, Union 4’s (specifically black noirs) look so good. May be biased since I own them, but that’s a great example of hype meeting history  </p>

            <h2>What release are you looking forward to the most this year and why? </h2>
            <p>  Not sure yet, UNLV dunks were a main chase for me but those passed. So maybe Raging Bull 5’s or Cool Grey 11’s </p>
