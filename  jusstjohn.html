            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> What got me into sneakers were the people around me and my environment. The different type of sneakers everyone wore on a day-to-day basis. I remember growing up wanting to be able to have varieties of sneakers to wear on different days of the week and not being able to afford it. I started collecting sneakers when i was in 6th grade  but to take it back a bit ,a year before I started collecting I was gifted a pair of “ Pharrell Williams bbc ice cream x board flips 2” by my father and I was stoked to wear those as it first started as my “statement shoe” then turned into a beater.</p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> Okay so this would be a two part answer just because it wouldn’t be right if I didn’t mention it, so I remember my first pair of shoes I was able to go pick myself and purchase it with my parents they were the “ Nike air Griffey Max 1 “ in the varsity blue colorway I was excited when I got it in hand BUT My 2nd shoe and the shoe that got me hooked to sneakers and got me collecting were the Nike foamposite pro “ pearl” wore that shoe almost everyday for a year until I destroyed the outsole </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p>  I wouldn’t say my collection is so unique as it is  a part of my livelihood experiences, all the shoes I’ve been able to curate throughout the years are shoes that I’ve either seen people on tv wearing like artists and athletes to my local everyday people I see in my surroundings. </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> I’ll choose history over hype even tho in my opinion they both go hand in hand in a sense. My reason being cause without the history of an iconic/classic shoe designers like Virgil, kanye west and the rest wouldn’t be able to create what they have in the past.  </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>  The best sneaker to release in 2020 in my opinion it’s a toss up between the Joe Fresh Goods New Balance 992 or the Off white Jordan 5  which I was able to go to Chicago and see them in hand.   </p>
