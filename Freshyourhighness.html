            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> I got into collecting around 98 but I didn't really get deep into it til the Concord 11 2000 release in Oct 2000</p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>Well my very 1st pair of kicks ever were the Jordan 1 Bred's in 85, but the very 1st pair I copped with my own money were the Bred 12's in 97. I would say that's what really started it. I had to have that pair bad. J's were still dropping during the week at that time, so I gave my pops the money to cop them since I had school. He played a huge joke on me & told me they were sold out & I was crushed. Woke up the next morning & they were sitting on my dresser. Wore them immediately that morning to school lol.  </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> I would say the diversity of my collection. It ranges from J's, Brons, Penny's, Air Maxes, Deion's, Barkley's, Griffey's, Foams, New Balance, Reebok's, Adidas, etc. I could keep going lol. I don't stick to just one brand or model. It's refreshing sometimes to walk out the house knowing it's gonna be rare to see somebody else with the same kicks you have on.  </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> History easy!!! To me hype is just a phase. People hype em up as the shoe of the year etc, but years later down the line the shoe holds no true value or has history. For example you know when you put the WC 3's on your feet, you know MJ won the slam dunk in them. You putting on let's say the Travis Scott 1's, there's no history behind it. It was just a collab that was hot at the time. History will never go away oppose to a hype shoe.  </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> My grail shoe are the Bred 1's. That was my very 1st shoe ever & I would love to have it again whether it's the Bred 1 model or the Banned Bred 1 model. Either or would do fine with me. I missed out everytime they've dropped & me having that shoe would literally complete my collection. </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p> I'd say it was tie between the UNC 3's & the Reebok Shaqnosis for me. Both shoes were so clean & made with great quality.    </p>

            <h2>What release are you looking forward to the most this year and why? </h2>
            <p>  I was really looking forward to the UNC 1's that dropped this year, but of course I wasn't able to get them. I love all Carolina colorways. I missed the last UNC 1's that dropped, so these would've been great to have. Besides those the Toro 5's are definitely on my list.  </p>

            <h2>What brands would you like to see collab this year?</h2>
            <p> I'm not sure but I would to see a new brand get a collab besides the usual Union, Kith, Supreme etc. I would really like to see something new & refreshing for a collab. </p>
