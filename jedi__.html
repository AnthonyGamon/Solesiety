            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> history. because it was fun. if you did your own homework/research, with the right amount of effort. you can secure. and hype? hype made this shit a business. and a very good business if i must say. but was also the downfall for it all imo. shoes is the ultimate coin now. such a grey area for it all. because now, for instance; if travis scott were to touch a pair of sb's / dunks, market spikes for it. why? idk. and these noobs hop on and all of a sudden seek to be an "influencer".. not all shoes get the love it should. which is also crazy.  </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> nike air yeezy 2 - solar. it came out on my one year anniversary. and me and my girl camped out on computers and laptops and phones. was driving store to store to catch a qs release. and pacquiao was also fighting that day. so distractions were everywhere. long story short, we spent the whole ass day waiting for shoes for me to miss.. lol but was lucky enough to hit shortly after.</p>
