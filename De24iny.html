            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p>Personally, I started buying my own shoes in middle school, but the shoe that reeled me in had to be the Air Force 180 25th anniversary. That really changed my perspective that there were more than just Jordan’s out there.  </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>My dad used to have every sneaker for me back in the day. I first got into sneakers that in can vividly remember was when I was 6 or 7 and I was wearing the last shots. I played flag football with the boys and that shoe really turned heads.  </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> I have a unique small collection. Dope seeing a female with sneakers with that tomboyish style but can switch it up too.  </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> History because there’s so many newbies here in the game now that have no idea that these shoes have released prior. There’s more meaning behind a shoe when there’s history tied to it.  </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> White Cement OG 3s. The colorway and elephant print is my favorite. The AJ3 is my absolute favorite. But the sleekness of the shoe is amazing. Also, MJ won the dunk contest in those. </p>

            <p>   "Dark Mocha’s The whole color way of the brown and black is suiting. Brown and that mocha colorway is so slept on except when it’s featured in the Travis Scott. The shoe itself is perfect. " </p>
