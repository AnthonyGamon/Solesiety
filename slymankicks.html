            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> I got into kicks at an early age; way back in the early 90s. My older brothers (I have 4), got me into them. I always wanted to emulate their style and passion for sneakers. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> The first pair that comes to mind are the Flint 13s from 1997/1998. I was in elementary school but they really sparked my love for sneakers. It was the first pair I really wanted and was able to hand the cashier the money to (given to me by my mom). </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> What makes my sneaker collection unique, is the fact that I wear any and all brands. No matter the mode or price of the sneaker; if I like it I’ll wear it. For me sneakers are a direct reflection of the person who’s wearing them. They say a lot about a person’s individuality and style.   </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p>  History over hype always. The reason being is because I’m a lover of nostalgia. I can tie a vast majority of my sneakers to a time in my life. Each sneaker usually has a story; especially the retros and older models.  The history that correlate with the sneaker is what makes them fun. Some hype sneakers are very dope and uniquely designed, but I’ll almost always choose a sneaker with history tied to them than hype. </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> My grail sneaker right now is probably an OG pair of “Military Blue” Jordan 4s.  The reason being is because the AJ4 is my favorite Jordan model. I was born December of 1988, so I think it’s genetically in me to like the 4s.  I am also a big fan of that color blue on sneakers, it doesn’t miss. Specifically, I think I’m so tied to the Military Blue 4s is because I remember purchasing the 2006 retro with my own money. I was working at a shoe store in high school and I loved them.  I enlisted in the military (Army) that year a couple months later and got rid of them due to me moving. I never got ahold of another pair and regret letting them go.</p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>  The best release of 2020 were the Flint 13s. The obvious reason is stated above; it was the shoe that started my true love for sneakers.   </p>

            <p> The release I’m looking most forward to this year (2021) are probably the lightening 4s. I missed out on them in 2006 and I love the model of course.     </p>
