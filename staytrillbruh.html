            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p>I got into sneaker collecting because I knew a few other people who were collecting and I had always loved the Tiffany dunk sb's. I've been collecting for almost a decade now. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>My first pair of sneakers I purchased were actually a pair of 2011 Black Cement 3's. I just really liked how that shoe looked and looked good with really anything. </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> I think a few years back I think sneaker collecting revolved around history and since it has shifted to hype. But I think both play an important role in sneaker collecting as time goes. </p>
