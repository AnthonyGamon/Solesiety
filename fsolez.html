            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p>Cdp Carmine 6s. 2012 During my high school days I was never really into sneakers till I saw my friends wearing all sorts of heat such as Hare 7s Dmp Raptors Space Jams etc always talking about the Nike Talk forums and eBay and aftermarket spots collecting shoes and such made me wonder how the sneaker world is and was till I finally got sucked into it and and that's where my love for sneakers sparked honestly feels like a never ending hunt finding and meeting all sorts of peeps for hidden and holy gems that brings everyone together who also share the same hobbies and interests makes it worth it all. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> Piston 6s. I honestly love the way 6s are made every bit of detail from the back tab to the tongue all perfectly put together and balanced into one iconic shoe what else there to say? I was on ebay one day after school and saw them posted for a what I guess was a steal in really good condition I'd even say they could pass as deadstock I was really stoked when they finally arrived couldn't believe it.wore that shoe down to the soles and leather was beat up I ended up giving them honestly regret it because they meant alot to me but shoes come and go new and better things will always come no matter what‚úå</p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p>I own a bit of everything regardless of hype or not If I like it I'll buy it. Simple as that.  </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> Hype because it'll eventually become history or not but every shoe is special and will always hold a special place in every sneaker heads heart for example Nike Sb Dunk infamous silhouette that came back and hit the market with prices sky rocketing with older models that have so many story's behind them all because of a famous artist named Travis Scott who wore them and gave them hype once more even though their part of history and have had and still have a huge impact in the sneaker community. As I say buy what you like and love not because everyone has or wants wear what you most feel comfortable with and enjoy wearing always be yourself no matter what. </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p>That's a tough one haha. I love every sneaker in my collection to only pick one but honestly if I had to choose one sneaker that made alot to me dearly enough to label as a Holy Grail it would have to be the best yeezy ever in my opinion which is the Nike Air Yeezy 2 Solar. I felt and feel like it paved the way for many artists and other shoes to be as wild as they are now a days trends coming in and out every single day all unique in its own way which is amazing but the shoe speaks for itself ever since I saw it I always dreamt of owning it someday till I eventually made it become reality and own a pair that'll never leave my stash and will forever hold a place in my sneaker vault every detail on it just justifys itself even if you're sneakerhead or not almost everyone knows how iconic it is for many more years to come. </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>  Union Air Jordan 4s. Chris did his thing as usual! Every bit constructed and put into detail felt nostalgic holding in it hand and focusing on every piece placed together to make it a master piece hope to finish the set eventually its a must cop to be honest before they hit more in price a shoe everyone should own or have in their collection üëç  </p>
