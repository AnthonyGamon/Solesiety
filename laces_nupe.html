            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> I started collecting back in 1996. I was in middle school and was able to buy my first pair of Jordans. I normally didn’t keep shoes prior to then and my shoe size has never changed since middle school. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>It was the Jordan 11 low IE with my own funds. That’s what started my collection. Normally my mother would purchase my pairs and I would wear them out to “beaters”. The Jordan 11 low IE white elephant print made me appreciate sneakers and start my collection. </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p>So I really tailored my collection to purchasing more Jordan retro 1 silhouettes. I was a big Jordan Brand fan of his releases from Jordan 1-15. I started letting a lot of pairs go and realized Jordan 1 aesthetically are versatile and can go into a business casual setting to informal setting with my outfits.   </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> If this is referencing the sneaker culture now it’s about “hype”. For me it’s all about the history and the man that created the sneaker culture... Michael Jordan. He created a brand and culture for everyone and every brand to create unique shoes. </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> My grail sneaker was the Jordan 1 “Banned” from 2011. This pair was a must have and I acquired the pair from a connect in France. </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>  Best release was the Jordan 1 “J Balvin” hands down. Nothing has been the innovative on a Jordan 1 silhouette since the Travis Scott release. The color scheme on the J Balvin was superb.  </p>
