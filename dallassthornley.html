            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> My manager at my first job like 6 years ago always used to pull up to work in the coolest sneakers and I was always mad jealous because I liked shoes but could never really get my hands on any jordans or anything. He was the first person who really helped me get an understanding of the sneaker world and helped me start and grow my collection. Without him I honestly don’t know if I ever would’ve realized I was a sneakerhead, probably would’ve worn vans forever.</p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>Jordan 1 Retro OG Phantom Gym Red. I still rock these probably once a week and baby them. there’s something about the shoe that I loved. The simple white leather with subtle red accents just made it a must have. And the crinkled leather just makes it that much more unique.  </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> I truly think everyone’s sneaker collection is unique because it represents what they like and the embodiment of their style. The most unique thing about my collection I can think of though is that I buy a lot of my shoes used and clean them up as best I can. That and like I already said it really embodies my own sense of style and what I like.  </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> I’m not a fan of following the hype. In this day and age of social media it’s so easy to fall into the lull of liking what everyone else likes just because everyone else is liking it. I believe in having your own style and expressing yourself. Thats one huge reason I love learning about the history of sneakers and the different releases of color ways, the different years a colorway has been retro’d, etc.. in my opinion there’s just something different about wearing a shoe that has some history behind it. </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p>That’s a loaded question but I would have to say the Diamond Supply Co ‘Canary Diamond’ Dunk SB’s. Yellow is my favorite color and I actually only have 2 yellow sneakers so that’s one reason and the shoe just pops. Has such a clean design. With the removable metallic swoosh, the yellow croc leather, and just the general hype of the release, it has to be one of my grails.  </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p> Atmos Dunk SB’s hands down. I’m not really a big air max guy but it just is one of the dopest color ways I’ve ever seen, and for it to be on a shoe that I can rock with is a major win for me.    </p>

            <p>  Got the White/White Slam Jam x Nike Dunks to complete the duo. </p>

            <h2>What release are you looking forward to the most this year and why? </h2>
            <p> I don’t really have my heart set on one specific drop this year. Lots of heat coming I’ll just see what I end up with at the end of the year!  </p>

            <h2>What brands would you like to see collab this year?</h2>
            <p>Dang you really got me stumped here.. I think that what Nike has done collaborating with these independent skate shops in the past has been really cool and I’d love to see more small time shops get a chance to bring their creativity to the world. Could be really cool for the sneaker community.  </p>
