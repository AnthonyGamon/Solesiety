            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> The sneaker industry has always had that hype dating back to the early 80's all the way to the current day. I got into sneaker collecting a few years back by one of my friends who used to collect pairs for fun. Every time he would win pairs such as the off-white 10 collection or the Beluga 350's he would always tell me his winnings as well as notifying me what the next releases are as he knew that I was interested in collecting sneakers. I started collecting when I won the raffle for the Yeezy Blue Tints back in 2017, however the collection didn't become prominent until I won the 700 Vanta's. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>The Yeezy 350 Blue Tints were the first pair that started my shoe collection. After losing out to numerous pairs such as the Pirate Black, Bred's, Zebras and many more in the past, Being that I was a huge Adidas fan over Nike back in 2017 I became more determined to kickstart my collection with a pair of Yeezy's and luckily for me I managed to win the Adidas raffle for  the Blue Tints and from there my collection started.  </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> Variety! Having a variation of shoes in your collection I personally feel is important as it allows you to express yourself freely instead of sticking to one style. The variation of sneakers in my collection allows me to switch up my fashion style as it can range from a pair of Jordan 's to a pair or New Balances to a pair of SB Dunks. With me switching up my style this ensures that I can celebrate my own individuality and show an accurate representation of my brand through my outfits and shoes.  </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> "The sneaker industry has always had the combination of history and hype dating back to when shoes such as Jordan 1 Black Toes releasing back in 1985 or the Jordan 4's Fire Reds in 1989. Regardless of which century or decade, the hype for sneakers has always been manic, more so now with the raffles such as Nike SNKRS, END Clothing, Offspring and others. With the rise of social media its made it easier for raffles to be done which has increased the hype of sneakers due to the possibility of consumers winning raffles as anyone can enter them and win whether they're a sneaker head or not. I prefer the history as I personally have a more sentimental feeling when I know the backstory of a particular shoe and why the model/colour way was created, for example the Jordan IV Bred's dropped when Michael Jordan won his first career MVP award back in February 1989. It makes it more worthwhile when adding to my collection.

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> My grail sneaker are the Jordan 1 Igloo. Nike released the silhouettes of the Igloo and the Rust Pinks back in December 2017 which I wasn't able to get my hands on. The Black Toe was reworked strictly for Miami with two South Beach-friendly colour ways that were connected to the cityâ€™s Art Deco heritage. Both pairs were originally my grail pairs however with the Rust Pinks finally being in my collection, the Igloo's are now the main pair I'd love to have. These are my grail sneaker due to the rarity of the shoe. With the pairs only dropping in Miami and in limited quantities having the Igloo's in my collection would make it more unique as not a lot of people in the UK will know or have them in theirs collections.</p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p> Despite the pandemic, I feel we have been fortunate to have so much heat dropping such as Ben & Jerry's Dunks, Off White x Jordan 6 the Dior 1's, Jordan 1 Mocha's and many more. My personal opinion would be the Off White 4 Sails due to the demand of the shoe but most importantly the colour way is simplistic but it can go with many fits which consumers can pull off.    </p>

            <p>The Off White X Jordan 1 Canary Yellows due to the colour tones used and the demand of the shoe is going to increase prior to the release date. I'm also looking forward to the fits of those that are able to get their hands on them.  </p>
