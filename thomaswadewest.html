            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> 2005 was when I started the collection. 2003 I got my first pair of hand me downs</p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> AJ13 He Got Games. Completely beat. My best friends older brother hooked me up. Shortly after I got some SB Mids, pre skated and some And1s which I loved too. Mostly used shoes for the first few years. I got really nice with the toothbrush and dish soap.</p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> Nothing really unique here. I have some shoes from 2004-2005, some GRs over the years, and some “grails”. Nothing too out of the ordinary, just stuff I like and know I’ll wear  </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p>  Both. It used to be all history for me, but pushing the category forward through new models and “hype” allows the game to evolve</p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> Tough choice. Might be the AJ6 Infrared. It’s the only shoe I have every re release of. I guess it’s because I wear them so often. They go with everything </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>   Probably the Muslin AJ5. They’re odd to me. I still haven’t got around to wearing mine yet. But this summer it’s going down.  </p>

            <h2>What release are you looking forward to the most this year and why? </h2>
            <p>   This might not be the right answer, but I’m not super excited for anything besides the Raging Bull 5s, which I hope should be pretty easy to get. But things change when we get closer to the release date, so we will see. </p>
