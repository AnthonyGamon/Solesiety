            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> I got into sneaker collection around 2007 and haven’t looked back since. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p> My first pair was a 2007 Jordan 8 Aqua, my cousin introduced me and it was an addiction I’d never felt before. </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> I think what makes my collection unique is a vast array of sneakers from PE’s to GR’s, I buy what I like and am a firm believer in that. I believe buying what you like and not feeling pressured to buy things just due to them being cool are key in sneaker culture.  </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> For me it’s history over hype, without the history the hype wouldn’t be alive. The models now that have been hyped happened like that due to original models starting a foundation for the hype.  </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> My grail sneaker is the Nike Flightposite Kryptonate, watching Nate Robinson dunk over Dwight Howard was iconic. I was a senior in high school watching that dunk contest and being from a small town I knew I would never get close to that shoe. Now im blessed to own a pair with an autographed box and one of the few out there that I was blessed to graduate college in. </p>

            <h2>What was the best release of last year and why? </h2>
            <p>   The best release for me was the Nike Sb Grateful Dead Dunk Low, with the colors and quality on the shoe it really did set it apart. The release was one that was crazy and horrible but needing a pair I ended up buying the yellow bear pair.  </p>

            <h2>What was your last pickup?</h2>
            <p>  My last pickup was the Adidas T-Max 2 Remastered, this shoe was nostalgic for me and I wanted a fresh pair to be able to wear.  </p>

            <h2>What release are you looking forward to the most this year and why? </h2>
            <p>  The release I’m looking most forward to this year is hopefully the release of the Jordan 1 Off White Canary. The color blocking on that 1 with the Off White accents really draws attention.  </p>

            <h2>What brands would you like to see collab this year?</h2>
            <p> Brands I’d love to see collab for me would be Air Max and Kaws again, after the first release years back it would be nice to see a new design. </p>
