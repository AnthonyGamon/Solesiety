            <h2>What and when did you get into sneaker collecting?</h2>
            <p> I had always appreciated sneakers throughout my life, but in 7th grade the first pair of NICE sneakers I bought was a pair of French Blue 12’s. Since then sneaker fever has ran though my bones. </p>

            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>French Blue 12’s were the first pair I bought once I started collecting. I bought this shoe because I loved the way the blue and white compliment each other and I loved the touches of red on the sole  </p>

            <h2>What makes your sneaker collection unique?</h2>
            <p> My sneaker collection is unique because it is composed of all MY favorite pairs. While there are pairs that are considered “hype” in my collection that’s not why I purchased them. Every shoe I own because I loved the way they look and I love the story behind them </p>

            <h2>Hype or history and why?</h2>
            <p> History for sure. And not just the history of the shoe/color way but the story of how the shoe came into my possession and who all owned it before. We’re all one big community and stories like that connect us all </p>

            <h2>What is your grail sneaker and why? </h2>
            <p> My grail is the Chicken and Waffle Nike SB Dunk. I remember seeing this shoe in the mall when I was younger but didn’t have the money to buy it at the time. I have regretted pulling the trigger on it ever sense </p>

            <p>   I think the Black nylon Sacai Waffle racer was the best sneaker released last year. It is such a clean and simple shoe yet still so elegant. Quite the underrated color way of this sneaker </p>

            <p> I would love to see a Chinatown Market and Nike shoe colab. Chinatown is my favorite streetwear brand and I think they deserve more attention than they get. </p>
