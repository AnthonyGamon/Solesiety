            <h2>What was the first pair in your collection and what made you get that pair?</h2>
            <p>First pair was the Flu Games but what made me start buying Jordan’s again was the Columbia 11s that released in 2014. I was deployed at the time and was new to everything and wasn’t able to hit online. Bought them when I got back for resale and till this day I haven’t worn them once   </p>

            <p> I would say a little both. Not your typical hype beast but I don’t mind going for hype items. I buy what I like and rock what I buy </p>
